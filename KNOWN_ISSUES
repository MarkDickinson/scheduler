I consider this an error with the systemd environment rather than with the
job scheduler itself. As such I will npt be spending any further time looking
into it.
The issue is systemd cannot start the job scheduler using the startup script,
running the startup script manually works.

The impact of this issue is simply that after rebooting a server you must manually
run the startup script from /etc/rc.d/init.d to start the job scheduler.

More details...

On systemd servers (ie:fedora) the SYSV init.d scripts are mapped to systemctl
services at system initialisation time in an attempt at compatability to allow
them to start as normal.
The systemd environment as currently implemented cannot start the job scheduler,
as seen below it says it started it but no job scheduler is running at the end
of the systemd startup; and no messages are logged to the scheduler log file
indicating it made any attempt to start.

[root@phoenix init.d]# systemctl status marks_job_scheduler

Feb 10 11:40:01 phoenix systemd[1]: Starting SYSV: Marks job scheduler...
Feb 10 11:40:01 phoenix systemd[1]: Started SYSV: Marks job scheduler.

[root@phoenix init.d]# ps -ef | grep sched
root        10     2  0 Feb01 ?        00:01:21 [rcu_sched]
root      6938  5044  0 11:44 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto sched



However running exactly the same init.d script manually works perfectly,
the scheduler starts and happily uses its log file.

[root@phoenix init.d]# ./marks_job_scheduler start

[root@phoenix init.d]# echo $?
0
[root@phoenix init.d]# ps -ef | grep sched
root        10     2  0 Feb01 ?        00:01:21 [rcu_sched]
root      7068     1  0 11:45 ?        00:00:00 bin/jobsched_daemon 9002
root      7094  5044  0 11:45 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto sched
[root@phoenix init.d]# 



In summary there are no issues with the job scheduler, there is an issue in
that systemd cannot start the job scheduler, but the resolution is simply to
run the /etc/rc.d/init.d script manually as that bypasses whatever issues
systemd has with starting the scheduler when it uses the same script.
