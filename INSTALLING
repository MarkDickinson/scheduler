THIS INSTALLATION METHOD HAS BEEN TESTED ON A FEDORA CORE 15 SERVER.
YOUR MILAGE ON OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MAY VARY.

NOTE: VERY GCC VERSION DEPENDANT, compiled and worked no probs on GCC3 up
      to FC3, compiled cleanly but did not work from FC4-FC13 on GCC4,
      compiles cleanly and works again from FC14 onward with GCC4. Wierd.
      Currently tested OK on Fedora28, compiler: gcc (GCC) 8.1.1 20180712 (Red Hat 8.1.1-5)

Documentation, where is it
==========================
Full manuals available as .ODT document files under doc/PDF
You should read these if you actually want to do anything with 
the scheduler (saved as the origional source .odt files).
The man pages are under doc/man/man1 and you should copy them
to /usr/local/share/man/man1 if you wish to use them, they are not
installed by the lazy_install_script

IMPORATANT UPGRADE NOTES (NOT REQUIRED FOR NEW INSTALLS)
========================
Because the database format may change between versions,
If you are upgrading from a previous release ensure you...
  PRE-UPGRADE
  * Shutdown your existing version
  * Use the jobsched_take_snapshot program to backup your existing
    configuration before starting.
  POST-UPGRADE
  * Delete the old *.dbs and config.dat files
  * Use jobsched_cmd < [your snapshot file] to reload the job,
    calendar and user definitions backed up by the
    jobsched_take_snapshot above (will recreate the files deleted).

Security Recomendations
=======================
Read the security manual (PDF in doc/PDF directory). By default the
application is pretty wide open to ip-traffic and has configurations
that can allow valid users to exploit. The default configuration is
to bind on all interfaces for an internal network with minimal security
requirements.

Installation Quick Start For the Impatient
==========================================
First get the source from git or my website

Installing and starting
-----------------------
The easy way.
.............
I have created a script lazy_install.sh in the
application directory that can be used to create the directory
structure required, compile the programs, customise and install the
init.d script; and goodness, even create an uninstall script.
If you want to do it that way just run ./lazy_install.sh
but you will have no idea of what is going on.
This is not recomended !.

The manual way
..............
It is preferable you know what you are doing

As root

cd /wherever/you/put/the/application/source
# make required directories
mkdir -p /opt/dickinson/scheduler
mkdir /opt/dickinson/scheduler/bin
mkdir /opt/dickinson/scheduler/etc
mkdir /opt/dickinson/scheduler/logs
mkdir /opt/dickinson/scheduler/joblogs
# initialise some control files
cat << EOF > /opt/dickinson/scheduler/etc/shell_vars
SCHED_BASE_DIR=/opt/dickinson/scheduler
SCHED_BIN_DIR=/opt/dickinson/scheduler/bin
SCHED_JOBLOG_DIR=/opt/dickinson/scheduler/joblogs
EOF
cp samples/alert_samples/alerts_custom.txt /opt/dickinson/scheduler
# compile the programs; AND delete the temorary object files
# created so git doesn't want to add them
cd src
./compile_all_linux /opt/dickinson/scheduler
find ./ -type f -name "*.o" -exec /bin/rm {} \;
cd ..
# Change the below 'mark' to a non-root user on your system
chown -R mark:mark /opt/dickinson/scheduler

# MANUAL STEP
vi samples/initd/server.rc3_d  and customise the below three values
   prod_port_num='9002'    # port number application will use
   local_host="127.0.0.1"  #(refer to manual, and security notes)
   installed_dir='/opt/dickinson/scheduler'
cp samples/initd/server.rc3_d /etc/init.d/marks_job_scheduler
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/marks_job_scheduler
chkconfig --add marks_job_scheduler
chkconfig marks_job_scheduler on


immediate online customisation needed
-------------------------------------
You should immediately add youself as an admin user so you no longer
need to use root to manage the scheduler

# start the jobsched_cmd program, AS THE root USER THIS TIME
#   example using the default port and localhost ipaddr
#   /opt/dickinson/scheduler/bin/jobsched_cmd
#   example using the default port and interface ipaddr
#   /opt/dickinson/scheduler/bin/jobsched_cmd 9002 169.168.1.189
#   example using a different port and localhost ipaddr
#   /opt/dickinson/scheduler/bin/jobsched_cmd 9010
#   basically if you change ipaddr you must provide the port
/opt/dickinson/scheduler/bin/jobsched_cmd

At the 'command:' prompt
(use your own unix userid and any password, not your unix password)
enter the below

  autologin
  user add mark,password abcdefgh,auth admin,autoauth yes,subsetaddauth admin,desc "Mark Dickinson"
  login mark abcdefgh

If the login as OK your new id can be used for admin functions instead
of needing be be logged in as root.
Also the autoauth yes flag means if you are logged on as yourself at
the unix level when you run jobsched_cmd you can use autologin instead
of login so don't need to remember your password (but you must be
logged in as yourself at the unix level for that to work)

While you are logged in you may as well also
  sched newdaytime hh:mm          (set to your newday start time)
  sched newdaypauseaction depwait (or alert, refer to the manual)

And may want to investigate the online 'help command'
To exit either enter the command 'exit', or make any typing mistake :-)

Optional installation of web interfaces
=======================================
There are two provided web interfaces targeted at different audiences
- web-interfaces/perl-cgi
- web-interfaces/tomcat      (tested using both Tomcat and Jetty)

The perl-cgi interface is targeted at operators managing the days active
job schedule. As it is a cgi interface running under the generic 'apache' 
userid it is not permitted to update any database entries (job/calendar/user etc)
but is only permitted to manage active scheduled jobs
(hold/release/runnow/delete off active queue/clear dependencies etc)
This can be performance intensive as for every person running this interface
the poll interval requires new connections to be created/destroyed to each
remote job scheduler.

The J2EE interface (tested under tomcat and jetty) is for administrators
and security groups. It requires that users login to the scheduler using
their personal scheduler userids (meaning the server can enforce it's security
roles on those users). As well as providing all the functions of the cgi 
interface it allows for the global management of jobs/calendars/users etc
across all configured servers.
Apart from the overhead of running Jetty (or the larger overhead of running
Tomcat) on the webserver, there is far less load on the remote job server hosts
as this interface maintains a constant 'pool' of connections to each remote
job server that are shared between all users of this web interface.

Summary
perl-cgi: operator access commands only, all commands issued under the apache id,
          multiple remote job scheduler connect/disconnects per user, high overhead.
J2EE    : access based on authority granted to the user logging on, full function,
          (N defined in config) N permanent connections to remote job schedulers
          created and kept open, shared between all users of this interface.

There are install instructions for each in the relevant directories.
These are optional.
