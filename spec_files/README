I keep my current spec files for this package here to avoid misplacing them.
If you want to use these you will have a lot of directory entries to change,
as they are hard coded for my source directory structures.

Output is to the standard rpmbuild tree.

The RPM files built are not perfect, specifically trying to 'dnf reinstall' 
from a repo leaves nothing installed for some reason.
