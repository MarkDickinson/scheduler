The alerts_custom.txt should be customised and copied into the
directory you installed the job scheduler into. You can create
customised alert messages for a range of job exit codes here.
That is covered in the main INSTALLING document for this app.

The two .sh files are 'stub' sctipts the scheduler can use to
forward alerts to external monitoring tools. By default this 
feature is not enabled but can be simply enabled (refer to the manuals)

Or quick start, as an admin authority user enter...
   SCHED ALERT FORWARDING EXECRAISECMD /full/path/to/raise_alert.sh
   SCHED ALERT FORWARDING EXECCANCELCMD /full/path/to/end_alert.sh

You should customise the two scripts to fit your environment before
enabling them of course.
