<H1>Disclaimer</H1>
<p>
This library is provided as is, without any warantee to suitability or accuracy
for any specific purpose. You use this library at your own risk. You modify
this library at your own risk.<br>
There is no support provided for this library.<br>
You have the code to review, use and change. You decide on the suitability
of this code for your environment.
</p>

<H1>Overview</H1>
<p>
This library provides a way for shell scripts to maniplulate dates. It does so
by basing every date on the number of minutes since Jan 1 BASEYEAR, where 
BASEYEAR is a value defined in the script library; currently 2003.<br>
The results of each function call are stored in the shell variable
<b>global_result_value</b>, you have to extract the results from that yourself.
</p>
<p>
You are encouraged to add your own enhancements as required. To facilitate
this the file <a href="#DTEST">datelib_test</a> has been provided to run tests against the library
functions. This should identify very quickly if any of your changes have
broken the library.
</p>
<p>
To use the library in your own scripts, at the start of your scripts include<br>
<b>. PATH/datelib_ksh</b><br>
replacing PATH with where you put the file of course. For example
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
year_to_check="$1"
. ./datelib_ksh
is_leap_year ${year_to_check} 
if [ "${global_result_value}." = "1." ];
then
   echo " ${year_to_check} is a leap year"
else
   echo " ${year_to_check} is not a leap year"
fi
exit 0
</pre>

<H3>datestamp_calculate</H3>
<b>Function</b>: create a library timestamp value for the date and time passed.<br>
<b>Syntax</b>: datestamp_calculate YYYY [M]M|MMM|MMMM... DD HH:MM<br>
<b>Result</b>: the variable global_result_value will contain the calculated library timestamp<br>
<b>Notes</b>: to create a datestamp without providing a time see <a href="#D6">date_to_datestamp</a>.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   datestamp_calculate 2004 01 28 10:50

<b>Function</b>: adjust the timestamp passed +/- the number of days requested.<br>
<b>Syntax</b>: datestamp_offset_by_n_days [-]nn DATESTAMP<br>
<b>Result</b>: the variable global_result_value will contain the calculated library timestamp<br>
<b>Notes</b>: to adjust a date rather than a timestamp see <a href="#D7">date_offset_by_n_days</a>
or <a href="#D5">date_n_days_ago</a>.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh

<b>Function</b>: returns the YYYY MM DD of the date nn days ago. Only returns days in the past, providing
a negative number will always result in 0 as a global_result_value.<br>
<b>Syntax</b>: date_n_days_ago nn<br>
<b>Result</b>: the variable global_result_value will contain the YYYY MM DD for the date nn days ago<br>
<b>Notes</b>: also refer to <a href="#D7">date_offset_by_n_days</a>.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   date_n_days_ago 4

<b>Notes</b>: if minutes are important to you also see <a href="#D1">datestamp_calculate</a>.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   date_to_datestamp 2004 01 28
   echo "The library timestamp for 2004 01 28 is ${global_result_value}"
</pre>

<b>Result</b>: the variable global_result_value will contain the YYYY MM DD date for the date offset 
the requested number of days from the daye provided.<br>
<b>Notes</b>: to adjust using a datastamp instead of a date see <a href="#D4">datestamp_offset_by_n_days</a>.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   date_offset_by_n_days -3 2004 Jan 28
   echo "The library date three days before 2004 01 28 was ${global_result_value}"
   date_offset_by_n_days 3 2004 January 28
   echo "The library date three days after 2004 01 28 was ${global_result_value}"
</pre>

it if you are to include your own functions in the library.</br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   get_minutes_in_year 2004
   echo "There are ${global_result_value} minutes in year 2004"

<H3>how_many_days_ago</H3>
<b>Function</b>: returns the number of days in the past a library timestamp is for.<br>
<b>Syntax</b>: how_many_days_ago DATESTAMP<br>
<b>Result</b>: the variable global_result_value will contain the number of days in the past the datestamp was.</br>
<b>Notes</b>: If a future date is passed the result will be 0.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   date_to_datestamp 2004 Jan 01
   how_many_days_ago ${global_result_value}

   if [ "${global_result_value}." = "1." ];
   then 
      echo "2004 was a leap year"
   else
      echo "2004 was not a leap year"
   fi
</pre>

<a name="#D12"></a>
<H3>num_days_in</H3>
<b>Function</b>: works out the number of days in the month.<br>
<b>Syntax</b>: num_days_in YYYY [M]M|MMM|MMMM...<br>
<b>Result</b>: the variable global_result_value will contain the number of days in the month.</br>
<b>Notes:</b>: The year must be provided. We need this to determine if it is a leap year.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   num_days_in 2004 02
   echo "There are ${global_result_value} days in February 2004"
   num_days_in 2005 February
   echo "There are ${global_result_value} days in February 2005"
</pre>

<H2>File helpers</H2>
<a name="#F1"></a>
<H3>minutes_since_file_modified</H3>
<b>Function</b>: works out the number of minutes since the file was last modified.<br>
<b>Syntax</b>: minutes_since_file_modified filename<br>
<b>Result</b>: the variable global_result_value will contain the number of minutes since the file 
was last modified.</br>
<b>Notes:</b>: uses the 'ls -la' command to obtain the last modified file time. If the file
was modified in a previous year (no minutes in the ls output, a year instead) the
minutes offset will be calculated from 00:00 of the day the file was modified.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   minutes_since_file_modified /var/log/test
   echo "/var/log/test was modified ${global_result_value} minutes ago"
</pre>

<a name="#F2"></a>
<H3>days_since_file_modified</H3>
<b>Function</b>: works out the number of days since the file was last modified.<br>
<b>Syntax</b>: days_since_file_modified filename<br>
<b>Result</b>: the variable global_result_value will contain the number of days since the file 
was last modified.</br>
<b>Notes:</b>: uses the 'ls -la' command to obtain the last modified file time.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre>
   . ./datelib_ksh
   days_since_file_modified /var/log/test
   echo "/var/log/test was modified ${global_result_value} days ago"
</pre>

<h1>The datelib_test script</h1>
<p>
As you are encouraged to enhance this library with your own routines there needs
to be a simple way of testing that you have not broken any of the shipped library
functions when you have been making changes.
</p>
<p>
To facilitate this the script <b>datelib_test</b> has been provided to run
basic sanity checks against the library. This should be run every time
you change the library to ensure it stll functions correctly.
</p>
<b>Syntax</b>: ./datelib_test<br>
<b>Notes</b> run this from the same directory the datelib_ksh file is in.<br>
<p>
Sample output from a test run is below.
</p>
<pre>
Date library checks.

This script will do fairly minimal checks against the date
library to confirm that all bits hang together properly.
This needs to be run after you make any changes to the library.

All tests in the script PASS OK when the script is run against
the supplied library.
If when you run it you get failed tests, then either fix or
backout the changes YOU or your sysadmins made to the library.
