These two jobs are provided as sample jobs, they are provided as they are
useful and should be run on your scheduler to prevent excessive log files.

null-scheduler-archive-logs   run weekly, backs up the scheduler log files and deletes older ones
sys-scheduler-backup          run daily, backs up scheduler config so scheduler config/jobs/calendars/uers can be rebuilt

Jobs can be added with the following command

cat << EOF | /opt/dickinson/scheduler/bin/jobsched_cmd
autologin
JOB ADD NULL-SCHEDULER-ARCHIVE-LOGS,OWNER root,TIME 20190713 05:10,CMD /opt/dickinson/scheduler/jobs/null-scheduler-archive-logs,DESC Archive scheduler logfiles,DAYS "SAT",CATCHUP NO
JOB ADD SYS-SCHEDULER-BACKUP,OWNER root,TIME 20190711 05:50,CMD /opt/dickinson/scheduler/jobs/sys-scheduler-backup,DESC Backup scheduler databases,CATCHUP NO
exit
