<h2>Job Displays</h2>
<p>
<b>Advisory note</b>: The display jobs with no repeat jobs displayed
is probably not going to work on your site. This is specifically
for my site where all my repeat jobs follow the naming standard
SYS-Rnnn so can easily be suppressed.<br>
If your site uses a different naming standard your admins
will have to customise the sample pages supplied.

<h2>Job Management</h2>

<hr>
<a name=#runnow><h3>How to make a job run NOW, Asking a job to run immediately</h3></a>
<p>From the job status overview screen you can select the <em>[Actions]</em> button to obtain a list
of possible commands you can issue for a job on the active queue.</p>
<p>The [runnow] button from this screen will alter the scheduled runtime of the current job to the
current time, making it immediately available to be scheduled on, <em>assuming the following conditions are met</em>.
<ul>
	<li>Job is not in a failed state</li>
	<li>job is not in a dependency state waiting for other jobs to complete</li>
	<li>the job is not held</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that even if all conditions are met the job may not immediately start running,
it will be scheduled onto the run queue
as available to run imediately, but may wait depending on current scheduler availablility
which may be such things as a NULL* (exclusive) job running or the maximum jobs already running.
It will be run when the scheduler is able to start the job.</p>

<hr>
<a name=#holdon><h3>Holding a job</h3></a>
<p>From the job status overview screen you can select the <em>[Actions]</em> button to obtain a list
of possible commands you can issue for a job on the active queue.</p>
<p>From this screen you can click on the button to hold the job. The effect will be that the 
job goes into a hold state and will not automatically run at the time due. It will not run
until the hold state has been cleared (see below).</p>
<p>If you hold a 'repeat'ing job, it will not attempt to catch up any missing intervals.</p>

<hr>
<a name=#holdoff><h3>Releasing a job</h3></a>
<p>From the job status overview screen you can select the <em>[Actions]</em> button to obtain a list
of possible commands you can issue for a job on the active queue.</p>
<p>One off the options is to clear the hold flag from the selected job. The effect of this is to
requeue the job onto the active queue at the time it was origionally scheduled to run.</p>
<p>It is important to note that 'repeating' jobs do not 'catchup'. If a job to run every 15 minutes
has been held, then released; it will run at the original time and then reschdule to the next time
after the current time, it will not attempt to catch up.</p>

<hr>
<a name=#delete><h3>Deleting a job</h3></a>
<p>Deleting a job is a systems administrator function.</p>
<p>Deleteing a job should only be done if this job is to also be deleted from the job definition database
immediately after the job is deleeted from the active queue. Or more bluntly <b>only ever delete a job
if it is never expected to run again</b>. Failure to adhere to this rule can result in time
scheduling becoming corrupted.</p>
<p>As such it is not available on the browser interface, it is something you can talk to
you system administrator about.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Alert Management</h2>

<hr>
<a name=#ack><h3>Acknowledging an Alert</h3></a>
<p>
From the 'Active Tasks' menu option you can chose to display the
current alert queue. One of the buttom options presented there is
to acknowledge the alert.</p>
<p>Note that this only changes the colour of the message when users view
the alerts screen, it remains red on the job status screen, simply beacause
an alert is an alert, and is treated as such on that screen.
</p>

<a name=#restart><h3>Restarting a failed job</h3></a>
<p>From the 'Active Tasks' menu option you can chose to display the
current alert queue. One of the buttom options presented there is
the option to restart a job.
<em>It is expected that the problem that caused the job to fail has
	been corrected before the job is restarted.</em></p>
<p>Note that the job will start running from the begining of the script.
The scheduler is designed to work on discrete work units and dependencies, if some of your
jobs do massive lots of work that havn't been split out; tough. The job will restart
from the beginning.</p>

<a name=#forceok><h3>Forcing a job from failed to completed state (into OK status)</h3></a>
<p>This option has not been provided in the browser interface. It is
available from the command line interface for systems administration use.
</p><p>Your system administrators can review the job log to determine
if a job needs rerunning, or is OK. If they decide it's OK they can
force the alert to be cleared.<br> This option is not available to point and click
as the job logs need to be reviewed before deciding this is an option, your system
administrators can force the job to an OK state, so talk to them.</p>
