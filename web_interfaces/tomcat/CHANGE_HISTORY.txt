History:
  The CGI interface was OK for operations monitoring, but as there was no real
  user tracking (all cgi scripts ran under the apache id) the admin functions
  were never added to the cgi interface.
  Tomcat with it's session tracking should allow each job scheduler user to
  login as their real scheduler userid, and allow a full function interface.
  [ Real reason: I wanted to play with JSP pages ]

Nov 2003, Installed Tomcat and started porting the CGI interface to JSP.
Dec 2003, Socket pooling and User objects working & tested, job status display running.
Feb 2004, All CGI functions ported. Working on new functionality.
Mar 2004, All common command line functions now available through the JSP interface.
Mar 2004, Added a buffer check and if required a delay when reading replies from
          servers (sometimes was reading before data had been fully read back).

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. Offset error from one of the command screens (can't remember which and
   after a disk crash have restored back onto a new (much larger yippee) disk
   from last months backups, which don't contain my debug notes on the issue
   which is a shame as it was a really easy fix).
2. The automatic screen refreshes don't work under mozilla (any version).
   Everything still works A-OK under IE.

WORK TO DO:
1. Add online help
2. Add scheduler control and debugging options ?
