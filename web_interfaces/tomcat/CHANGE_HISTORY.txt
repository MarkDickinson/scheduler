History:
  The CGI interface was OK for operations monitoring, but as there was no real
  user tracking (all cgi scripts ran under the apache id) the admin functions
  were never added to the cgi interface.
  The J2EE/JSP interface forces users to logon with their real scheduler userids
  so allows a full function interface.
  [ Real reason: I wanted to play with JSP pages ]

Nov 2003, Installed Tomcat and started porting the CGI interface to JSP.
Dec 2003, Socket pooling and User objects working & tested, job status display running.
Feb 2004, All CGI functions ported. Working on new functionality.
Mar 2004, All common command line functions now available through the JSP interface.
Mar 2004, Added a buffer check and if required a delay when reading replies from
          servers (sometimes was reading before data had been fully read back).
Nov 2018, Re-tested under Jetty (as I now use Jetty insterad of Tomcat as Jetty has
          a much smaller footprint) to make sure it still worked after quite a few
          server changes.

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. Offset error from one of the command screens (can't remember which and
   after a disk crash have restored back onto a new (much larger yippee) disk
   from last months backups, which don't contain my debug notes on the issue
   which is a shame as it was a really easy fix).
2. The automatic screen refreshes don't work under mozilla (any version).
   Everything still works A-OK under IE.
