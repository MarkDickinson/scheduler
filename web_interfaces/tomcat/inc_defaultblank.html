<H1>Scheduler JSP Interface</H1>
<p>Welcome to <b>Marks Job Scheduler <small>&copy Mark Dickinson 2002, 2003, 2004</small></b>
JSP interface application.
</p>
<p>Select the options you wish to work with from the menu line above. If you
have one specific page you will be doing all your work from you can bookmark
that page rather than this one, and you will be taken directly to the page
after you have logged on without seeing this screen again.
</p>
<p>The JSP interface has replaced the original apache operator-only web interface
for day-to-day use as it provides full user tracking via the unique JSP session
id feature. Users have to logon as themselves and are accountable for their own
actions.<br>
It also allows for session pooling, a dedicated pool of re-useable permanently
connection sockets is used to communicate with every managed server, avoiding
the need for the cgi-script and command line interface execution required for
each request from the original operator-onlt apache web interface.
</p>
<p>If you do not have Tomcat installed on any of your servers the original
apache operator-only interface is still provided with the toolkit, all commands
are tracked under the apache userid for that interface however, and no admin
tasks are available through that interface.
</p>
<p><b>This toolkit is provided as shareware. If you have not paid the shareware
fee you are not entitles to any support, updates or bug fixes; but are free to keep using the
toolkit as long as you wish.</b>
</p>
