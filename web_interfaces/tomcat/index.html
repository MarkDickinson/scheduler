The job scheduler JSP interface is designed to provide a frontend to <b>Marks
Job Scheduler, &copy Mark Dickinson 2002, 2003, 2004</b> application.
By providing the interface as a Tomcat JSP application I am able to provide
full session authentication for authorised scheduler users, enabling the JSP
code to implement the role segregation functions designed into the scheduler
application itself; by performing authorisations against the scheduler
databases and using Tomcats inherent session tracking ability.
</p>
</p>
It has also allowed the use of permanent re-useable socket connection pool 
entities which significantly cuts down on connection overheads.
