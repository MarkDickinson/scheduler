<H1>Security Details</H1>
<p>
This page <b>covers some of the key fields in a user record</b>. It
is not intended to replace the manuals that were shipped with the
product. For full details of how user authority works you <b><em>must</em></b>
refer to the manuals.<br>
This page provides only a brief description of what fields on the
add user JSP interface screen relate to.
</p>
<h2>User Authority Level</h2>
<p>
Users are defined in a role based model, limiting access to the role thay
can perform.<br>
Scheduler functional management classes are in a very basic form
<ul>
<li>user management</li>
<li>schedule database management, creation/deletion of jobs and calendars</li>
<li>interactive control of job flows on the current scheduling queue</li>
</ul>
The user authority levels relect this, the user authority classes you may add a
user to are one of
<ul>
<li><b>0 - guest</b>,<br> has read access to active scheduler queues, job
and calendar databases, and user databases. Can change and control
nothing.</li>
<li><b>O - Operator</b>,<br> has read access to everything. <b>Full control
of jobs on the active scheduler queue</b>; which is can reque
failed jobs and do alert management tasks, can clear job dependencies,
override job scheduling times for the active days job etc. Only has
control of the active days batch jobs. Can manually submit jobs from
the job database but <b>does not</b> have access to
create/delete/alter jobs, calendars or user details. Has read access to
everything</li>
<li><b>J - Job authority</b><br> is for the batch scheduling teams. Users
at this authority level can create/alter/delete definitions for jobs
and calendars. The <b>cannot</b> submit the jobs to the scheduler
active queue or manage the jobs in any way once they are on the active
queue (thats the operators role). Has read access to everything.
<li><b>S - Security</b><br> is for the security teams. Has the ability to
add and delete users, and change user passwords. Has <b>no access to
the job or calendar databases, and cannot control jobs on the
active scheduler queue</b>; altough theres nothing to stop a
security user adding themselves a new record with full access, I guess
you have to just trust them. Has read access to everything.</li>
<li><b>A - Admin, should only be granted to the server
administrators</b>.<br> Has full access to resolve problems in all
databases (user, job, calendar) and control of the active job queue.
<b>In addition</b> the admin user can control the job scheduler(s)
itself, to customise newday times, alert forwarding options, debug and
trace options etc. <b>This is a requirement of the server administrator
and the server administrators/systems programmers should have
this access reguardless of any concerns your security department
may have</b>. Any site where server administrators/systems
programmers do not have full admin rights is in violation of any
support contracts signed, and the site committing the offence will not
be permitted to lodge fault calls.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note</b>: the unix level <b><em>root</em></b> user is always permitted
to autologin (see below) to the admin level for problem resolution
purposes. This isn't a security risk as your site obviously has access
to the root userid tightly controlled; which is why server admins and
systems programmers should be granted full admin access, they should
not have keep running around demanding the root signon just to
manage the job scheduler application.
</p>
<h2>Command line autologin allowed</H2>
<p>This is not considered a security risk. This is designed to allow
support staff and general users to get on with thier jobs with a
minimum of complexity.<br>
If this is set to <b>yes</b> then a user logged on to a unix server
under a unix level userid (presumably a personal id), that exactly
matchers a job scheduler userid, can use the autologin command to log
onto the job scheduler application without needing to enter their
password.<br><br>
This is not considered a security  risk as
<ul>
<li>They have already logged onto the unix server natively, so
are a valid user</li>
<li>logging onto the scheduler only grants them the scheduler
authority rights the matching userid has within the job
scheduler.</li>
</ul>
It also allows batch jobs to be run against the scheduler without hard
codeing a password in scripts.<br>
<b>Note:</b> as mentioned above, the unix level <b><em>root</em></b> user can
always autologin to full administrator level through the command line
interface.
</p>
<h2>Able to add users</h2>
<p>
There is a <b>subsetauth</b> facility designed to allow the security department to offload some of
the work involved in adding user to department managers.<br>Also occasionally,
although I would expect infrequently there would be a requirment to allow a user
not in the security department to fully manage user records. This would
probably be in a large site an operations shift leader needing to change
passwords or add on-the-fly records for support staff during out-of-hours
problem resolution.<br>
There is a special flag in the user record for this. For the puposes of the
user add screen you invoked this page from the descriptions are
<ul>
		<li><b>No</b>, the simple one, they cannot manage users</li>
		<li><b>SubSet Auth</b>, for managers. They can add user records for new
		users up to the authority they have been granted; for example if a
		<b>Job</b> authority manager can create job records for users A, B and
		C, and have subsetauth authority they can create other user records for
		people that will be allowed to define jobs to run under the unix userid of one, two or all three of those
		users; but not any additional users.<br>
		<b>Note:</b> users with subsetauth cannot delete or modify users once
		they have been added, so care should be taken in granting this to
		ensure it is only given to managers that sign in blood that they will
		always inform the security department when a user leaves</li>
		<li><b>Full security authority</b>, is effectively granting the user
		all rights of the security authority level group on top of their own
		authority rights. This should be reserved for out-of-hours support
		staff or fire-call userids.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>The unix userid fields</h2>
<p>
The job scheduler servers run in the unix (Linux primarily) environment, and
as such need a legal unix userid to run jobs under.
In the fields provided on the form for this enter a list of unix level
userids that the user is able to define jobs for. <b>Ensure you only
add authority to unix userids the appropriate department manager
has approved and taken responsibility for</b>, as theres nothing to stop
the user you are about to add coding a 'rm -rf' command under an entered
userid.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of this help page, any userid(s) you enter in the fields here
will grant the job scheduler user you are about to add the ability to run any
job they wish to run under the userid(s) you enter.
