any of the new features.

-------------- START OF CHANGE HISTORY LOG ---------------

Change Type Key: (S) Security change
                 (I) Internal function change
                 (U) User requested change
                 (*) Bug fix for Major impact problem
                 (+) Bug fix for minor impact problem
                 (N) New program included


Fixes Since V1.17
-----------------
None: Version V1.17 is this release.

Fixes Since V1.16
-----------------
2019/07/24 - (*) Changes in jobsched_cmd to fix an error in
                 in converting the repeatevery value, reguardless
                 of the user input value jobsched_cmd always put a
                 value 010 in the data buffer. It now populates that
                 value in th data buffer sent to the server to add
                 the job with the correct user supplied value.

Fixes Since V1.15
-----------------
2018/10/27 - (*) Lots of changes to get it to compile on FC28 with GCC 8.1.1
             (*) Commented out one line in api.c Set_LF processing that was
                 causing jobsched_cmd to segfault when processing the response.
             (+) For GCC 8.1.1
                 Changed a log of valid strncpy statements to use memcpy in cases
                 where data contents were known to supress a lot of warnings
                 when truncation was desired. Changed some pointer references
                 to suppress further warning messages.
                 Still a lot of warnings for snprintf and strncpy statements
                 but they are deliberate truncations and not an issue.
                 Added a few extra tweaks to debugging level code to help
                 track down problems.

Fixes Since V1.14
-----------------
2012/02/21 - (I) Replaced all hard coded 70 lengths with JOB_LOGMSG_LEN in
                 schedlib.c, no problem but should always have used the
                 constant.
             (I) added a comment in schedlib.c above the two strncpy lines
                 that valgrind reported as being copying over themselves,
                 saying it is deliberate and no problem.
             (+) jobsched_cmd was allowing "alert info " (no jobname), now
                 checks a jobname is present and aborts jobsched_cmd if not
                 (must exit, still using fast fail to stop scripts doing damage).
             (I) changed compile_all_linux to compile with symbols for now

Fixes Since V1.13
-----------------
2011/12/21 - (I) Removed all code blocks managing licensing, basically a cleanup
                 of no longer required code as licensing was never implemented and
                 its free gplv2 now anyway. MANUALS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED.
             (I) Added newdaytime and loglevel options to the jobsched_cmd
                 help sched display; function was alsways there but not in
                 the display
2011/04/05 - (I) Updated text shown to user when starting jobsched_cmd to show
                 GPL V2 release instead of just GPL release.

Fixes Since V1.12
-----------------
2011/03/21 - (I) Fixed a few message numbers to make them unique; they were
                 identified as duplicates while I was converting the html
                 manuals to PDF (ok .ODT) format so I can retire the out-of-date
                 html documentation. Included in the distro gpl-2.0.txt license.

Fixes Since V1.11
-----------------
2011/03/13 - (*) Finally completed conversion to allow it to be compiled under
                 GCC 4.5.1 or above. No function changes, just a lot of code
                 block replacements (with defines so it can still compile under 
                 GCC 3.n if needed) to replace the sections that used system calls
                 that compiled cleanly under GCC 4.n but were passing garbage or
                 segfaulting if compiled under the later versions of the compiler.

Fixes Since V1.10
-----------------
2009/02/01 - (+) Bug fix for jobsched_take_snapshot, the calendar dump had
                 the days offset down by one, forgot to allow for array
                 starting at zero. Running out of things to fix, so finally
                 fixed this one.

Fixes Since V1.09
-----------------
2007/01/26 - (*) Bug fix for 'dep clearall dep' causing server to crash
                 that was introduced into a new version build between 1.09
                 and 1.10 releases.
2007/01/26 - (+) Changed server startup config display to use the same 
                 version banner as all the other modules
                 (from server_globals.h instead of hard coded in module)


Fixes Since V1.08
-----------------
2005/07/12 - (+) Bug fix to calendar scheduling functions. Updates to a
                 (proc global no less) variable made inside a loop were
                 lost on exit from the for loop. Used a staging variable
                 of 'z' and eveything worked when copying values into/from
                 that (gcc compiler bug ?). Minimal impact, in a seldom used
                 function (no user reports of encountering it).
2005/07/12 - (+) WORKAROUND implemented for problem of database compressions
                 only ocurring at loglevel info; change to info at startup
                 and newday then revert back to user selected level when done.
2006/01/01 - (I) Tidied dir structure, job logs moved to joblogs dir, server
                 logs moved to logs dir, and binaries moved to bin. Just keeps
                 the app directories less cluttered (changes to server.c,
                 server_global_data.c and schedlib.c, package script, install
                 script and rc3.d script).


Fixes Since V1.07
-----------------
2004/01/18 - (S) Implemented logoff function in the server, and placed into
                 jobsched_cmd also to allow testing. This is for connection
                 pooling I am working on in the servlet interface so when an
                 idle connection can be reused I can flush the current
                 authority from the server connection table when I release the
                 servlet pool entry (so I son't have to close/open socket to do
                 so).
2004/02/10 - (I) Changed the format of the login OK message to a comman format
                 for all logins; so the JSP interface can parse it easily.
2004/02/29 - (N) Included my ksh/bash script date library toolkit with the app.
2004/06/17 - (I) Changed the prefix search option in sched and job listall to
                 use a true wildcard mask (* character) for searches. Updated
                 documentation with the change.
2004/06/19 - (N) Created the jobutil program. Not yet full function. What it
                 does do already is in the manuals. 


Fixes Since V1.06
-----------------
2003/09/22 - (I) Implemented a common memory management module for use by
                 all scheduler modules, allows display of memory chains
                 in use and provides better memory tracking during change
                 testing.


Fixes Since V1.05
-----------------
2003/09/12 - (I) Implemented unique message numbers for all messages
                 and wrote the html messages manual.
2003/09/20 - (*) Fixed bug where a repeatinterval of 10 always somehow
                 became translated to 0 (was 10 when written to disk, 0
                 when read back). This caused an endless loop incrementing
                 by 0 to the next runtime. [1-9 and 11-infinity worked
                 fine, it was only the value 10 that had this problem ???]
                 No logic error to fix, did the below change to remedy.
2003/09/20 - (I) Changed the storage of the repeatinterval value to a string
                 value rather than an integer value and adjusted logic to
                 handle the value being a string. This was the way it should
                 have been anyway as I don't want to pass binary values
                 across the socket interface.
2003/09/20 - (N) Provided the user inactivity and file security checking
                 report program with the application.


Fixes Since V1.04
-----------------
2003/02/22 - (U) Added ability to run an external script each time an alert is
                 raised or cancelled (for forwarding to other apps ideally).
                 Added the alert_tools directory to have sample scripts to be
                 run when an external program is called.
2003/06/02 - (I) prefix 'cat /dev/null | ' to each bash command run. This is
                 to handle any scripts that may prompt for input.
                 Prior to this they would just hang waiting for input.
                 Note: no batch jobs should prompt !, however I specifically
                 tested for this, and found the need to have /dev/null piped
                 to the command.
2003/06/02 - (I) Changed socket options on startup to SO_REUSEADDR as on
                 my linux server even though netstat showed nothing on the
                 port it could take over two hours before a restart of
                 the scheduler stopped getting port in use errors.
2003/06/22 - (I) If newday fail action is depwait rather than fail there
                 was no alert notification when it ran late. Added some
                 logic to raise an alert if this happens and the batch 
                 window runs past time. Also added logic to clear the
                 alert when the newday finally runs. This keeps it
                 similar to processing when the newday late action
                 was to fail, as the failure raises alerts.


Fixes Since V1.03
-----------------
2003/01/05 - (I) Fixed issue with old calendars not being deleted on year
                 rollover (forgot to add 1900 to current year in compares
                 there). Committed version change to V1.03.
2003/01/13 - (I) Added help for the SCHED LICENSE command under sched help
                 in jobsched_cmd.
2003/01/22 - (U) Added the OPEN command to jobsched_cmd so user can connect
                 to a different server without needing to stop/restart the
                 program.


Fixes Since V1.02
-----------------
2002/09/20 - (I) added a hostname field in the API header so a process
                 recieving an API buffer knows what host it came from.
                 This is prework for the server to send unsolicted updates
                 to clients where the client may be monitoring multiple
                 servers.
2002/10/19 - (+) fixed memory leak in jobsched_cmd job add function.
2002/10/19 - (I) Added calendar processing into the server and calendar
                 stubs. Added calendar functionality to jobsched_cmd.
2002/11/25 - (I) Implemented full calendar functions, and tested. Fixed a
                 few printf lines that should have been going to the log.
2002/11/25 - (+) Fix bug in jobsched_cmd where
                 with multiple adds would pass previous parm to a job
                 if the new job had no parm. Minimal impact, only really 
                 seen when a new server is setup and a batch job load
                 performed.
2002/11/25 - (S) Fully implemented user role functions.


Fixes since V1.01
-----------------
2002/08/02 - (S) jobsched_daemon
                 added code to allow the server to be configured
                 to bind to a single interface, still defaults
                 to all interfaces.
                 Reason: I wanted to run it on my firewall system
                 but only let it listen internal network port, not
                 the external one as well.
2002/08/16 - (I) All code using sprintf was changed to use snprintf
                 as when I compiled it using cc on sun solaris the
                 sprintf function just did not work, and returned
                 large negitive numbers for the string lengths. The
                 snprintf on solaris returned the correct value so
                 I changed all sprintf to snprintf.
2002/08/19 - (I) Added system_type.h file so compiles for SOLARIS
                 can be controlled by a define check in the code.
                 Added code changes needed to allow for solaris
                 not having the INADDR_NONE defined and needing the
                 environ data to be explicitly declared as extern.
                 Still having trouble with va_start in solaris though.
2002/09/01 - (I) Added a catchup override flag at the job definition
                 level so jobs can be excluded from catchup processing.
                 ie: so my daily backup doesn't run 5 times while
                 catchup processing is being done.
2002/09/15 - (U) Added support for alerts_customised.txt file so users
                 can customise alert messages.
2002/09/15 - (I) Added last logged on and password last changed to
                 user info reply buffer.
