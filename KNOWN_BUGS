The repeatevery option should not be used when defining jobs at this point in time.

After adding a job with repeatevery 180 a job info shows it is set to repeat every
10 minutes rather than the 180 expected, and it does try to run every 10 minutes so
this is a bug in the job add function I need to fix.

Unfortunately it has been years since I needed this function so don't know how long
it has been broken. Bug discovered 2019/06/22.

Immediately added to repository. known_bugs file will not be removed until fixed.
